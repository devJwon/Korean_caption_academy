https://github.com/devJwon/humor-image-captioning/blob/main/images/ny_image/image_7.jpeg?raw=true,It's just the wind.,We really need to revisit our immigration policy.,"A person is sitting up in bed looking at a pillow with an imprint of a head on it, while a surreal large image of the moon or Earth appears outside the window.",It's just the wind.,"A person is sitting up in bed looking at a pillow with an imprint of a head on it, while a surreal large image of the moon or Earth appears outside the window.",We really need to revisit our immigration policy.,"{""selected caption number"":""3""}

The caption ""We really need to revisit our immigration policy."" humorously suggests the absurd notion that the Earth itself has immigrated to the bedroom through the window. It plays on immigration as a topical issue while anthropomorphizing the Earth in a surreal and unexpected way that relates to the bizarre image. The other captions merely describe elements of the image without adding much humorous interpretation."
https://github.com/devJwon/humor-image-captioning/blob/main/images/ny_image/image_11.jpeg?raw=true,"Frankly, your brochure is a bit misleading.","Now, at the actual wedding tomorrow, let's keep Heather off the vodka.","The picture is a black-and-white cartoon showing a group of people in what appears to be a medieval setting, with two individuals holding unusually large pencils while one person sharpens the tip of their pencil on a wall, indicating a humorous take on sword sharpening.","The picture is a black-and-white cartoon showing a group of people in what appears to be a medieval setting, with two individuals holding unusually large pencils while one person sharpens the tip of their pencil on a wall, indicating a humorous take on sword sharpening.","Now, at the actual wedding tomorrow, let's keep Heather off the vodka.","Frankly, your brochure is a bit misleading.","{""selected caption number"":""2: Now, at the actual wedding tomorrow, let's keep Heather off the vodka.""}

The caption humorously ties the medieval setting and figures holding large pencils to a modern wedding rehearsal gone awry due to excessive drinking. It's an unexpected and amusing juxtaposition between the drawing and relatable real-world situation."

The first caption humorously suggests that Larry, the shorter man, is involved in some secretive project, playfully poking fun at his height compared to the others. This caption adds an amusing backstory to the image beyond just describing the difference in stature."

The DVR is set. You can catch the game tomorrow.,I guess this rules out a church wedding.,"{3:'I guess this rules out a church wedding.'}

The third caption humorously suggests that based on the man's inappropriate display, a traditional church wedding is no longer a suitable option for the couple. It plays on the contrast between the man's lewd behavior and the propriety expected in a church setting."
https://github.com/devJwon/humor-image-captioning/blob/main/images/ny_image/image_49.jpeg?raw=true,Stop me if you've heard this one.,It's just the wind.,"A cartoon depicts a man at a bar with a phone to his ear, seemingly indifferent to the clone-like businessmen reflected multiple times in the mirror behind him.","A cartoon depicts a man at a bar with a phone to his ear, seemingly indifferent to the clone-like businessmen reflected multiple times in the mirror behind him.",Stop me if you've heard this one.,It's just the wind.,"{selected caption number:'2: Stop me if you've heard this one.'}

The cartoon humorously depicts a man at a bar on the phone, seemingly oblivious to the row of identical businessmen reflected behind him in the mirror. Caption 2 plays off this surreal imagery, as if the man is starting to tell a joke, despite the absurdity of the situation with the clone-like figures. It's a witty, self-referential line that highlights the strangeness of the scene in an amusing way, making it the most humorous and relevant caption choice for this cartoon."

The selected caption humorously implies that the bird landed on the fishing pole after springing out of a jewelry box, given its rigid pose. This unexpected comparison between ice fishing and a whimsical trinket adds an element of absurdity and humor related to the scene."

The second caption is the most humorous and relevant to the bizarre image of a car parked in the middle of a living room. It implies the people are robots or AIs who have been programmed to do something stupid like parking a car indoors, and humorously asks ""Higgins"" what their excuse is for similar idiotic behavior. The caption plays off the absurd visual in a witty way."

The first caption humorously imagines the giant creature asking for directions while peering into the window, as if on a phone call. This plays off the absurd visual of King Kong casually talking to someone inside the building. The second and third captions don't have the same level of humor or creative spin on the bizarre scene depicted."

The second caption, ""And if you'll agree to drop the divorce proceedings and reconcile I'll throw in a pair of lobsters"", is the most humorous and relevant to the cartoon image depicting a couple having drinks at a bar. It humorously implies the man is trying to bribe his wife with lobsters to save their marriage, making light of a serious situation in a whimsical way that fits the casual, sketched style of the cartoon."
https://github.com/devJwon/humor-image-captioning/blob/main/images/ny_image/image_164.jpeg?raw=true,"Come sweater season, you'll be back!",I just couldn't 'catch and release because who would've believed such a whale of a tale?,"A person is entering a room filled with goats, with some goats sitting on furniture and others standing on a bookshelf, while a man seated in an armchair appears unfazed.","Come sweater season, you'll be back!",I just couldn't 'catch and release because who would've believed such a whale of a tale?,"A person is entering a room filled with goats, with some goats sitting on furniture and others standing on a bookshelf, while a man seated in an armchair appears unfazed.","{selected caption number:'3'}

The third caption humorously captures the absurd scene of a person walking into a room filled with goats occupying furniture and shelves, while the man sitting calmly seems completely unfazed by the bizarre situation. It paints a funny mental image directly relevant to the amusing sketch."

This caption humorously plays off the surprising and absurd image of a man casually holding a turkey under his shirt in an office setting. The caption treats the turkey as if it were a drink being offered, adding to the surreal humor of the situation. The other captions are either too literally descriptive without enough humor, or don't tie into the specific bizarreness of the image as effectively."

You pick up.,"{selected caption number:'3: I'll order. You pick up.'}

The selected caption humorously personifies the abstract figures, suggesting they are placing a food order together. This adds an amusing interpretation to the otherwise ambiguous sketch by imagining the figures interacting in a relatable human scenario. The other captions either just literally describe the image or make a political commentary that doesn't directly relate to or find humor in the specific elements of the drawing itself."
https://github.com/devJwon/humor-image-captioning/blob/main/images/ny_image/image_185.jpeg?raw=true,Hi there!

Can I interest you in some promotional material about intelligent design?,"A cartoon depicts a naked man casually walking away while a bear holds what appears to be his clothing on a stick in the background, suggesting the bear stole his clothes.","{""selected caption number"":""1""}

The first caption ""Or you could just move the damn coffee maker."" humorously suggests a simple solution to the man's predicament of having his clothes stolen by the bear while he was presumably skinny dipping. Rather than chasing the bear, moving the coffee maker that apparently lured him out of his clothes in the first place would avoid the whole situation. This adds an absurd but funny implication to the silly scene depicted in the cartoon.

The other captions, while somewhat amusing, either rely on an unrelated joke or merely describe the scene without adding much humorous commentary directly tied to the cartoon's content."

Damn, I've forgotten my safe word!",I wish they would just go back to tapping our phone lines.,"{""selected caption number"":3}

The caption ""I wish they would just go back to tapping our phone lines."" humorously implies that the bizarre, chaotic scene depicted is some kind of massive government surveillance operation, which would actually be preferable to old-fashioned phone tapping. This unexpected comparison and desire for a ""lesser of two evils"" type of privacy invasion makes for an amusing juxtaposition with the whimsical, surreal visuals in the sketch."

But he still says the rest room in there is for employees only.","An astronaut on the moon looks perplexed as they discover a person buried up to their waist, seemingly engaged in an act of vandalism amid a minimalist lunar landscape.","{""selected caption number"":3}

The selected caption ""An astronaut on the moon looks perplexed as they discover a person buried up to their waist, seemingly engaged in an act of vandalism amid a minimalist lunar landscape."" humorously juxtaposes the surreal scene of an astronaut encountering a bizarre sight of someone half-buried and spray painting on the barren moon surface. The unexpected absurdity makes this the most humorous and relevant caption for the cartoon drawing."

The caption ""They ignored your first ten. What makes you think you'll do any better with these?"" humorously suggests the couple in bed are potatoes that have been rejected many times before, poking fun at the absurdity of anthropomorphizing potatoes as a couple. It ties in directly and cleverly with the humorous illustration."

The cartoon humorously depicts a patient on a psychiatrist's couch who has the body of a crocodile or alligator from the waist down. Caption 3 plays off this absurd visual by having the patient make an equally absurd request to cancel lunch plans and bring an impractically large baguette instead, as if that was a perfectly normal thing to ask in this bizarre therapy session. The caption maximizes the humor by building on the surreal situation shown in the cartoon."

The caption ""You don't have to tell me it's a vanishing breed"" is the most humorous and relevant to the cartoon image. It cleverly plays on the idea of cowboys being a ""vanishing breed"" in modern times, while the visual depicts one cowboy's horse as literally vanishing or elongating into an absurdly long-legged creature. This caption ties the humorous visual elements to the broader contextual meaning in a witty way."

The first caption ""I think we made a wrong turn at puberty"" is the most humorous and relevant to the cartoon image. It plays off the idea that the awkward, comical scene depicted represents an embarrassing mishap or detour in life, metaphorically comparing it to the often awkward transition through puberty. The other captions either blandly describe the image or make references that don't directly relate to the silly scenario being portrayed."

The simple drawing of a two-headed snake resting in the grass provides an amusing juxtaposition with the caption ""Please stop asking, honey. If anything, you look too thin."" The snake's two heads could represent a couple, with one head self-consciously asking the other about its weight. The response humorously dismisses the concern, implying the snake is clearly quite slender already. This adds an element of relatable humor and wit to the otherwise plain, childlike sketch."

The third caption, ""Jockeys are humorously depicted as racing each other on hobby horses at a racetrack, a playful twist on a traditional horse race"", is the most humorous and relevant to the provided image.

Caption 3 (""Let's just say I thought I had one wish left."") is the most humorous and relevant to the image. It humorously implies that one of the stranded individuals on the tiny desert island had wished for something, but ended up stranded instead, with just a small hut and absurdly out-of-place bus stop bench. The caption plays off the incongruity of the situation depicted in a witty way."

The selected caption ""You're cut out for this job"" humorously plays on the silhouette shape cut out of the bar that the man appears to be smiling at and interacting with as if it were a real person. The double meaning of ""cut out"" referring to both the bar design and being well-suited for a job makes this caption clever and the most humorous fit for the quirky optical illusion depicted in the cartoon."

The second caption, ""Sorry, but I have to play it where it lies,"" is the most humorous and relevant to the image. It cleverly ties together the operating room setting with the golfer's insistence on playing the ball from its current position, as per golf rules, even in this absurd situation. This juxtaposition creates an unexpected and comical scenario."

The image humorously depicts what appears to be a weasel or rodent-like character campaigning for votes among a group of elderly people. Caption 3, ""As a weasel, I need your vote"", plays off this absurd juxtaposition in a witty way, imagining the weasel character as a slick politician soliciting support. The other captions either lack humor or are less directly relevant to the surreal elements of the cartoon drawing."

The caption ""Robin totalled the Batmobile—again!"" is the most humorous choice that is relevant to the cartoon image depicting Batman standing at a subway station looking perplexed. It humorously implies that Robin crashed Batman's Batmobile, forcing Batman to resort to using public transportation. The caption adds a funny narrative to the unusual sight of a costumed superhero waiting for the subway."

The caption ""Every time I go to Williamsburg, I just feel more and more out of place."" is the most humorous and relevant to the image. It amusingly suggests that the human couple feels like outsiders in a cafe filled with rhinoceroses, as if this surreal scene is a normal occurrence in the trendy Williamsburg neighborhood. The juxtaposition of the mundane human reaction to the absurd situation of rhinos casually hanging out in a cafe creates an entertaining contrast that makes this caption stand out as the funniest choice."

The third caption is the most humorous and relevant to the image. It cleverly plays off the fact that one of the diners has sunk into a large pie on the stove, implying this ""service"" of being baked into the meal is not included on the menu the others are studying so intently, unaware of their companion's predicament. The caption amusingly juxtaposes the absurd visual with a mundane comment one might actually hear at a restaurant."

The caption ""Please! I have a wife and two thousand kids!"" is the most humorous and relevant to the image of the bear watching the fish jump out of the river. It anthropomorphizes the fish in a funny way by imagining one of them pleading with the bear not to eat it because of its large family.

I have a wife and two thousand kids!,That won't fly in here.,"{selected caption number: 'That won't fly in here.'}

The caption ""That won't fly in here"" is the most humorous and relevant to the provided cartoon image. The boy is holding an oversized rolled mat or carpet compared to the girl's standard yoga mat, with the caption implying his oversized mat is not allowed or suitable for the ""Beginner's Yoga"" class they appear to be attending. The humor comes from the exaggerated size difference in their mats and the play on words with ""fly"" related to yoga poses. While the other captions have some humorous elements, this one most directly and cleverly relates to the specific context of the yoga class setting depicted in the cartoon."
https://github.com/devJwon/humor-image-captioning/blob/main/images/ny_image/image_519.jpeg?raw=true,It took us years to get somebody in the inside.,Hi there!

The first caption humorously implies that the birds have been patiently waiting for a long time to infiltrate the human world and get someone on the ""inside"", playing on the idea of the bird being perched on the human's hand. It's an amusing personification of the birds plotting and succeeding in their mission.

The second caption, while somewhat relevant, is less humorous. And the third caption merely describes the image without adding any humor.

Therefore, I selected the first caption as the most humorous and relevant to the given cartoon image."

I'm at the window. To the right? Your right or my right?""}

The first caption is the most humorous and relevant to the image. It cleverly imagines a funny conversation taking place in the depicted scene, as if the man is receiving directions over the phone while standing at the window. The other captions either just blandly describe the scene or make less contextual sense for the image."

The first caption, ""I just couldn't catch and release because who would've believed such a whale of a tale?"", is the most humorous and relevant to the image. It plays on the absurdity of the huge fish jumping over the car, likening it to a whale and an unbelievable ""fish tale"". This caption adds an element of humor by imagining the person's justification for keeping such an improbably large catch.

The second caption merely describes what is seen in the image without adding any humor. The third caption, ""There's really nothing to it"", while mildly amusing, does not specifically relate to the context of the giant fish and the shocked car occupants. Therefore, caption 1 is the clear choice for the most humorous caption directly relevant to this funny illustration."

The first caption merely describes the scene literally without any humor. The third caption is not directly related to the events depicted in the cartoon.

Caption 2, ""Why don't you get the coffee this morning?"", humorously implies that the man who jumped off the cliff is going on an errand to fetch coffee, despite the perilous leap he just took. The juxtaposition of the mundane coffee request with the extreme BASE jumping scenario makes this caption amusingly absurd and the most humorous fit for the cartoon."

The first caption humorously suggests the clown bartender might spray the drink in the perplexed man's face rather than serving it normally. This unexpectedly absurd scenario plays off the unusual setting of a clown working as a bartender, making it the most humorous and relevant caption for the cartoon image."

But who'da thunk the hamsters would inherit the earth?,We'll have to run it by our infinite number of editors.,"A person is running inside a large stationary wheel, reminiscent of a hamster wheel, located in a room with an open door.","{""selected caption number"":""1""}

The caption ""It's Karma !! But who'da thunk the hamsters would inherit the earth?"" is the most humorous and relevant to the image. It amusingly suggests that hamsters have taken over the world, drawing a funny parallel between the person running in the oversized hamster wheel and actual hamsters. The other captions either lack humor or are overly descriptive without adding a humorous twist."
https://github.com/devJwon/humor-image-captioning/blob/main/images/ny_image/image_570.jpeg?raw=true,THE St. Francis?,"Lily pad . . . lily plant . . .

Damn, I've forgotten my safe word!",THE St. Francis?,"{""selected caption number"":""2""}

The second caption ""Lily pad . . . lily plant . . . Damn, I've forgotten my safe word!"" is the most humorous and relevant to the image. It humorously implies the birds are overwhelming the man on the bench, as if he is part of some uncomfortable or unwanted situation and has forgotten how to make it stop (the ""safe word""). This caption adds an unexpected and funny interpretation to the scene depicted in the sketch."

You pick up.,"{selected caption number:'3'}

The caption ""I'll order. You pick up."" is the most humorous and relevant to the provided image of two cyclists on an absurdly long tandem bicycle. It cleverly plays on the exaggerated length of the bike, suggesting the front rider will place an order somewhere while the back rider, being so far behind, will have to pick it up later. This adds an amusing twist to the already comical illustration."

The caption ""Business school changed you, Son."" is the most humorous and relevant to the quirky illustration. It amusingly suggests that one of the people stringing up the clothesline between buildings has become pretentious or eccentric after attending business school, explaining their unorthodox laundry hanging method utilizing a church steeple. The other captions either ask an unrelated question or merely describe the scene without adding humor."

Can you meet me at the hospital in about ten minutes?""}

The second caption humorously implies the rider will end up injured at the hospital after being thrown from the horse while attempting the jump. It relates directly to the action shown in the comical illustration while adding a humorous touch, so I selected it as the most fitting and funny caption for the image."

The caption ""They keep watch on the offshore accounts."" is the most humorous and relevant to the cartoon image depicting a knight in armor and a middle-aged person casually having wine together. It humorously suggests these unconventional dining companions are colluding on shady financial dealings, which is an amusingly absurd interpretation of the scene. The other captions either blandly describe the image or reference details not clearly present."

The caption ""He just walked by like he thinks we don't exist."" is the most humorous and relevant to the image.
